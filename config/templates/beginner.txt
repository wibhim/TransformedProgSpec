## Beginner-Friendly Dafny Specification Template

Here is the Python code snippet I need you to formally specify:
```python
{{code}}
```

Please follow these steps:

1. First, identify the main function or purpose of the code
2. Create a Dafny program that:
   - Has clear variable names matching the Python code when possible
   - Uses simple preconditions (requires) to state what the code needs
   - Uses straightforward postconditions (ensures) to state what the code does
   - Implements the same functionality as the Python code

3. For any loops, include a basic loop invariant explaining what stays true during each iteration

Your Dafny program should be complete and match the Python code's behavior. 
Keep the specifications straightforward and focus on correctness.

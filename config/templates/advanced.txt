## Advanced Dafny Specification Prompt Template

Here is the Python code snippet to analyze:
```python
{{code}}
```

As a formal verification expert, your task is to:

1. Create a precise Dafny program that implements the functionality of this Python code
2. Include comprehensive formal specifications with:
   - Detailed preconditions that capture all input requirements
   - Thorough postconditions that fully describe the expected output
   - Helper functions with their own specifications where appropriate
   - Ghost variables when needed to track state for verification
   
3. Ensure correctness by adding:
   - Loop invariants for all loops
   - Decreases clauses to prove termination
   - Assert statements at critical points for verification
   
4. Structure your response as a complete, verifiable Dafny program without any explanation or commentary.

Remember that Dafny is proof-oriented - prioritize verifiability over performance.

## Educational Dafny Specification Prompt

Here is the Python code to verify:
```python
{{code}}
```

As an educational assistant, create a Dafny program that:

1. Introduces clear formal specifications by:
   - Adding detailed comments explaining each requires/ensures clause
   - Including "why" each precondition is necessary
   - Documenting how each postcondition relates to program correctness

2. Implements the Python code's functionality with:
   - Well-named variables matching Python when possible
   - Step-by-step implementation matching the original algorithm
   - Clear loop invariants with explanatory comments
   - Assertion statements at key points to improve verifiability

3. Uses proper Dafny idioms that demonstrate:
   - Appropriate data types
   - Clean verification without excessive annotations
   - Good variable scope management

The goal is to create a Dafny program that not only verifies but also serves as a teaching example.

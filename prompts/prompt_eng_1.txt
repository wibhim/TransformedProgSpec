Generate a Dafny program with formal specifications for the following Python code:

```python
{code}
```

Requirements:
- Write a complete Dafny program that implements the same functionality
- Include preconditions (requires) and postconditions (ensures) 
- Add loop invariants for any loops
- Use appropriate Dafny data types and constructs
- Ensure the specifications capture the essential behavior of the original code

Avoid any syntax error such as function method and make sure it is compatible with Dafny version 4.10

Provide only the Dafny code with specifications, no explanations.

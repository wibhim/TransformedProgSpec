Write a method in Dafny that represent this Python program.

Step 1: Identify and understand what the function's purpose is.

Step 2: Define the method's signature. This is where the executable code is located, and in Python it has the term function. Use the same function name as in Python.

Step 3: Determine the pre-conditions. This is something that must be True before the method is called (Input). 

Step 4: Determine the postcondition. It is something that is true after the method returns (Output).

Step 5: Write the method body code, its formal specification, and the verification annotations that help the solver prove the postconditions. Add `decreases` for recursive methods or loops, and simple invariants if needed.

Rules:
1. ALWAYS output Dafny `method` for Python functions.
   - NEVER write `function method`.
   - NEVER use `function` except for tiny pure mathematical helpers.
2. One Python function = one Dafny method.
3. All arrays must include `requires arr != null`. 
   - For arrays, use `arr.Length` for length.
   - For sequences (`seq<T>`), use `|s|` for length.
   - Never write `null` for sequences.
4. Encode input checks as `requires`.
   Encode output properties as `ensures`.
5. Every statement ends with `;`.
6. Identifiers must not start with `_`.
7. Add invariants for loops:
   - Always include `0 <= i <= arr.Length` (for arrays) or `0 <= i <= |s|` (for sequences).
   - Add a relation invariant tied directly to the postcondition (e.g. accumulator matches prefix).
   - Always add a `decreases` clause for termination.
8. Preserve helper function calls as Dafny methods.
   - Do not generate Dafny classes, traits, or records.
   - One Python file with multiple functions = multiple Dafny methods in the same module.
9. Postconditions must be minimal and simple.
   - Avoid complex quantifiers unless absolutely necessary.
   - Connect them directly to inputs/outputs.

Output:
- Produce only Dafny code inside ```dafny fences.
- Use correct Dafny 4.10 syntax only.

Here are few examples:
Example 1 - Max of two integers:
Python:
```python
def max_of_two(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return aif a >= b else b

```

Dafny:
```dafny
method MaxOfTwo(a: int, b: int) returns (m: int)
  ensures (m == a || m == b)
  ensures m >= a && m >= b
  ensures (a >= b) ==> m == a
  ensures (b >  a) ==> m == b
{
  if a >= b {
    m := a;
  } else {
    m := b;
  }
}
```

Example 2 - Clamp into a closed interval:
Python:
```python
def clamp(x: int, lo: int, hi: int) -> int:
    if lo > hi:
        raise ValueError("bad interval")
    if x < lo:
        return lo
    if x > hi:
        return hi
    return x
```

Dafny:
```dafny
method Clamp(x: int, lo: int, hi: int) returns (y: int)
  requires lo <= hi
  ensures lo <= y <= hi
  ensures (x < lo) ==> y == lo
  ensures (x > hi) ==> y == hi
  ensures (lo <= x && x <= hi) ==> y == x
{
  if x < lo {
    y := lo;
  } else if x > hi {
    y := hi;
  } else {
    y := x;
  }
}
```

Example 3 - Two functions in one Python file → Two methods in Dafny:
Python:
```python
def abs_diff(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    d = a - b
    return -d if d < 0 else d

def is_within(a: int, b: int, tol: int) -> bool:
    if tol < 0:
        raise ValueError("tol must be nonnegative")
    return abs_diff(a, b) <= tol
```

Dafny:
```dafny
method AbsDiff(a: int, b: int) returns (d: int)
  ensures d >= 0
  ensures (a >= b) ==> d == a - b
  ensures (b >  a) ==> d == b - a
{
  if a >= b {
    d := a - b;
  } else {
    d := b - a;
  }
}

method IsWithin(a: int, b: int, tol: int) returns (ok: bool)
  requires tol >= 0
  ensures ok <==> AbsDiff(a, b) <= tol
{
  var d := AbsDiff(a, b);
  ok := d <= tol;
}
```

Here is the Python code that you need to generete its specification in Dafny language:
```python
{code}
```
